# 📚 1. Introduction
The AI Bubble Pressure Score (AIBPS) integrates multiple empirical traditions from economics, behavioral science, finance, and innovation research to quantify systemic pressure in the AI ecosystem. The model draws from three major intellectual lineages:

1. **Asset bubble early-warning indicators**  
2. **Technology diffusion and S-curve adoption theory**  
3. **Behavioral finance and sentiment-driven regime models**

The sections that follow summarize the theoretical grounding for each pillar and explain why the AIBPS architecture is appropriate for detecting macro-level pressure in the AI economy.

# 🧠 2. Economic & Financial Bubble Models

## 2.1 Classic Bubble Definitions  
Bubbles are typically defined as sustained deviations of market prices from fundamental value, driven by self-reinforcing feedback loops (Kindleberger & Aliber, 2011). Early signals include:

- accelerating capital inflows  
- compressed risk premiums  
- explosive credit expansion  
- rising speculative participation  
- narrative overheating  

These properties recur across history: tulips, South Sea, railroads, dot-com, crypto.

The AIBPS “Market” and “Credit” pillars are designed to detect such structural precursors.

## 2.2 Price Dynamics & Superexponential Growth  
Sornette’s log-periodic power law (LPPL) framework shows bubbles often exhibit **superexponential acceleration** before collapse (Sornette, 2003). While AIBPS does not explicitly implement LPPL, its normalization and smoothing detect similar curvature inflections.

## 2.3 Macro-Financial Indicators  
Research shows that spreads, liquidity conditions, and corporate borrowing patterns often deteriorate before bubble reversal (Borio et al., 2018).  
Therefore, AIBPS tracks:

- High-yield OAS  
- Investment-grade OAS  
- Financing conditions  

to approximate systemic credit sensitivity.

# 🏭 3. Technology Diffusion & Adoption Theory

## 3.1 S-Curves & Generational Waves  
Everett Rogers (2003) describes new technologies diffusing through sigmoid (S-curve) patterns.  
AI and cloud services follow similar dynamics:

- early foothold  
- acceleration during enterprise adoption  
- plateau during commoditization  

AIBPS captures this using the **Adoption** pillar (Enterprise Software, Digital Labor, Cloud Services, Connectivity).

## 3.2 General Purpose Technologies (GPTs)  
AI is widely considered a GPT (Brynjolfsson, Rock, & Syverson, 2021). GPT waves exhibit:

- long diffusion lag  
- major complement investment requirements  
- skill, infrastructure, and process restructuring  

This motivates the **Infrastructure** and **Capex Supply** pillars.

## 3.3 Complementary Innovation & Capital Deepening  
Successful GPT transitions require massive capex in specialized assets (Bresnahan & Trajtenberg, 1995).  
Our Capex pillar tracks:

- semiconductors  
- hyperscaler investment  
- fab equipment indices  
- data center expansion  

---

# 🏗️ 4. Physical Infrastructure Constraints

## 4.1 Supply Chain Bottlenecks  
AI deployment is constrained by:

- GPU availability  
- foundry throughput  
- grid capacity  
- substation buildout  
- cooling limits  
- fiber & core networking  

Empirical analyses (IEA, 2024; Uptime Institute, 2023) show physical limits can throttle AI diffusion regardless of market enthusiasm.

Our **Infrastructure pillar** measures these limits using fed series for industrial production, electricity capacity, and manufacturing output.

## 4.2 Power & Cooling Dynamics  
AI clusters exhibit extreme power density. Grid interconnection queues and transformer shortages are now major bottlenecks (FERC, 2023).  
The AIBPS pipeline will increasingly incorporate these constraints as more publicly available series emerge.

---

# 🧱 5. Investment, Capex, and Buildout Cycles

## 5.1 Historical Big-Build Cycles  
The semiconductor and compute industries repeatedly cycle through:

- Capex boom  
- Supply glut  
- Price collapse  
- Exit & consolidation  
- Recovery  

These capital-heavy cycles magnify bubble dynamics (Flamm, 1988; O’Mahony & Van Ark, 2003).

## 5.2 Hyperscaler Spending Behavior  
Hyperscaler capex drives most modern AI infrastructure growth. Observed patterns:

- Heavy pre-investment during optimism  
- Cooling or retrenchment shortly after overbuild  
- Countercyclical moves near hardware bottlenecks  

These trends make hyperscaler capex an ideal bubble pressure indicator.

# 💼 6. Labor, Productivity & Organizational Adoption

## 6.1 Digital Labor & Automation  
Measurement of digital labor complements (productivity, unit labor costs, ICT investment) provides insight into:

- automation substitution  
- complementary skill demand  
- restructuring pressure  
- early-stage enterprise AI integration  

These factors are captured in the **Adoption pillar**.

## 6.2 Organizational Psychology & Technology Uptake  
Adoption is shaped by:

- uncertainty reduction  
- perceived usefulness  
- leadership signaling  
- organizational readiness  
- capability maturity  

(See: Venkatesh et al., 2003; Monnot & Beehr, 2022.)

AIBPS integrates these adoption precursors via enterprise software investment and digital labor productivity trends.

# 📣 7. Sentiment, Narrative, and Behavioral Finance

## 7.1 Narrative Economics  
Shiller (2019) argues that economic cycles are strongly influenced by public narratives.  
AI is arguably the strongest narrative driver since the internet boom.

AIBPS measures this via:

- Google Trends intensity  
- news volume  
- NLP-derived hype signals  

## 7.2 Attention-Based Market Dynamics  
High attention levels increase speculative participation (Da et al., 2011).  
Sentiment surges often precede valuation excess.

This underpins the **Sentiment pillar**.

---

# 🧩 8. Composite Index Theory

## 8.1 Why Summarize into a Composite?  
Composite indicators are useful when:
- underlying systems are multidimensional  
- no single metric sufficiently captures risk  
- leading indicators differ in timing  

(E.g., OECD leading indicator methodology.)

## 8.2 Normalization  
AIBPS uses **rolling z-sigmoid scaling**, which provides:
- long-term comparability  
- outlier control  
- percentile-like interpretation  

## 8.3 Weighting Rationale  
Weights default to equal due to:
- lack of prior theory on relative importance  
- similar historical explanatory power  
- transparency & interpretability  

Advanced users may override weights.

# 🧪 9. Why AIBPS Is Useful

AIBPS is not a forecasting tool.  
It is a **pressure gauge** — similar to the Chicago Fed NFCI or EPU indices — designed to detect:

- overheating  
- structural fragility  
- hype-driven accelerations  
- physical/infrastructure bottlenecks  
- systemic imbalance  

It provides an empirical basis for discussions about “AI bubbles” rather than relying on anecdote or price movements alone.
